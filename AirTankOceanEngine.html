<h3>Section 1:  Ocean Float-Tank Engine</h3>
<textarea id="id_t_1" class="class_t_1" >
Inventor:  Richard Isaac Craddock
Date:  12/28/2022 (December 28, 2022)

I just invented clean, free, efficient energy for the entire globe.

Air-tite, ship-large tanks, filled with patroleom aerated foam (or other floating material).

Pipe down into the ocean, empty pipe inserted, open at the top, "L-shaped" at the bottom; door at the "L-shape" at the bottom

The force of the tanks falling push a gear that opens the door.

A pump to the top of the ocean empties a tank compartement.

The gear pushed (run; operated) by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean, pushes the next tank into the L and up into the water-tight compartment; the bottom of the tank is then closed by a door (operated, once again, by the gear pushed/run/operated by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean); then, a door on the side of the tank is opened, allowing water into the tank, underneath the hollow, affixed-to-tank, platform of the tank, thereby pushing the tank upward toward the top of the ocean.

How to insert the pipe to the bottom of the ocean.

Pipe (the main pipe), open at the bottom; open at the top; large enough (length, width) to hold (to house, to encompass vertically) a tank (an air-tight, engine-component, extremely large (ship-size) tank); insert into the ocean. Slot at the bottom (half a cirle slot opening in the side of the pipe); insert metal circle slab into slot; seal the slab into the pipe; pump out the water from the pipe.

Water-filled tank in pipe; when pipe fully inserted and slab sealed, then a hose to the bottom of the ocean, to the water-tank, pumps the water out of the tank, filling the tank with air; a very small, empty pipe to the bottom of the ocean, inside of the main pipe.

<h3>Section 2:  Sky-scraper Float-Tank Engine</h3>
<textarea id="id_t_2" class="class_t_1" >
Sky-Scraper Float-Tank Engines
Date of Invention:  12/28/2022 (December 28, 2022)

1.  Pipe (tube) of water to raise tanks; to turn gears (turbines)
2.  Empty Tube to lower tanks

    
Chain or Belt

Gear

Chain Arm (or belt arm)
Chain arm extensions
Chain-arms extend from the chains on at least two-sides of the water-path of the 
Belt-arms extend from the belt over the float-tank rise (ascension to surface of water) path area; float-tanks push arms upward by natural, free force in the water; the arms, as attached to the belt (or chain) push the belt upward, turning the gear at the top (or bottom) the belt (in the case of an float-tank-ocean-engine, the gear box turbine system will be at the top of the ocean; whereas, contrarily, the sky-scraper float-tank-engine may have the turbine gear system at the top (or bottom) of the building; sending electricity down (or up) thru the building.

The float tanks will be rectangular cubes.

Reasons
1.  A rectangular large float, with an arrow-dynamic top, is more easy (more simple) to manufacture than a circular-float-tank.
2.  A simple two-arm per each long-side (top) of the rectangular-float-tank can be protruded to stablely secure the upward force of each float-tank.

Float-Tank Engine (an edit to the initial design)
Date of Edit of Details About the Invention:  12/29/2022 (December 29, 2022)

Smaller pipe to the bottom of the ocean; how, as follows:

float-tank sections as square-shaped slots, parts of the composition of the float-tank.

example:


float tank composed:  [____________]

or otherwise depicted as:  [|||||||||]

float tank parts:  [] + [] + [] + []

or otherwise depicted as:  [|  +  ||  +  ||  +  ||  +  ||  |]

Where each section connects to each other section to form (compose) the entire unit float-tank.

Where each section is detachable to permit it slide down (free fall by gravity, but connect to each by belt arms on either side of the free-fall pipe - which belt turns a turbine.

Where roof is arrow-dynamic, same as was designed before except as:, but is, also, per this design, composed of detachable sections, each of whose parts can fit in the free-fall pipe to descend to the bottom of the engine system, in the ocean (or otherwise).

Float-Tank-Components-Assembly
Float-tank composite parts are assembled (connected) to compose the float-tank-unit; where  -  at the bottom of the engine system, in the compartment beside the water-tight-air-tight-ascension-compartment

Sections of the Engine
Date:  12/29/2022 (December 29, 2022)

turbine-belt:  height:  design 2

10% parts per float-tank-height

If 100 float-tanks, then turbine-belt-height = (1/10 * (height of tank * 100 tanks)

Location
The turbine-belt is located at the top of the engine system, below the surface of the fluid volume part (such as the surface of the ocean) of the engine system.
The force of the connected-to-each-other, ascending float-tanks, pushes upward those float-tanks, at the top of the system, connected to the turbine-belt, moving the turbine-belt, which moves the turbine to create electric output (electron-flow-to circuit, energy result).


Ascension to Surface Procedure
Tank-to-Tank Connections
Tank-to-Pipe Connections
Guide Rail Above Water-Tight-Asencsion Compartment While aiming with rutter (wing components for float trajectory system of the each float-tank).
Sonar/Radar/Laser/Thermo-Scanning/Camera/Pipe-Arm Guidance system
Slot connection slot to connect
Pipe-guide-arm; guide arm lock; guide arm spring, guide-arm unlock upon spring half-way activation; then, free-motion-flow connection from pip-to-arm-to-float-tank during float-tank asencsion to surface

Synthetic-Water-Fall Turbine Engine
Date:  12/29/2022 (December 29, 2022)

Pipe to the bottom of the ocean (or other depth downward, vertically, into the ocean).

Pendulum arm fill * 4, per pipe water-fall

Pendulum arm lowers
fills arm tank with water
2nd pendulum asenscion (simultanous to 1st-arm-tank-filling activity) causes motion of gear, gear motion pushes water out of 1st-pendulum-arm-submerging-vessel-tank, meanwhile, lock is on over rise-lever of 1st-pendulum-arm, preventing 1st pendulum arm rise-activity (upward motion of arm, to pour water into the water-fall pipe); where rise-activity is caused by float-object-block, upon release of pendulum rise-lever (arm of pendulum arm, fastened to pendulum arm).
