<h3>Section 1:  Ocean Float-Tank Engine</h3>
<textarea id="id_t_1" class="class_t_1" >
Inventor:  Richard Isaac Craddock
Date Invented:  12/28/2022 (December 28, 2022)
Last Update (most recent date edited):  12/30/2022;  01:47 AM

I just invented clean, free, efficient energy for the entire globe.

Air-tight, ship-large tanks, filled with petroleum aerated foam (or other floating material). PSI-capable. Increasing the PSI (pressure) in the float-tanks can increase the force exertion upward, causing the turbine rotation power to be greater.

Pipe  -  a pipe is inserted, down into the ocean, the pipe is empty (not filled with water or an other substance or object, except, as well as otherwise described later in this document, it does have a smaller pipe object, insert, in it, going down to the bottom of the engine system, to the water-tight compartment); the pipe is open at the top; the pipe is "L-shaped" at the bottom; there is a door at the "L-shape" at the bottom which is the entry-way to the water-tight compartment, into which the air-tight float-tanks are loaded, for the purpose of transitioning their passage into the fluid, by which the float-tanks rise to the surface, pushing the arms of the turbine-belt upward, thereby operating the turbine rotation power to generate electricity.

Float-Tanks Descent
The force of the float-tanks falling (drop; descent; gravity downard travel force) push a gear that opens the door. 
The descent force pushes a gear system which operates a number of things, including: (1) the door of the water-tight-ascent-copmartment; (2) the dolly-on-rail-platform-vehicle which carries the float-tanks thru the L-shape bottom toward and into the water-tight-ascent-compartment.

Deprectated description-line:  A pump to the top of the ocean empties the float-tank compartment.
Improved description:  A pump empties the excess water of the bottom floor location of the engine system  -  the pump empties the water into the water-tight-ascent-compartment when the water-tight-ascent copmartment is in the process of being loading with the consecutive float-tank via the rail vehicle and otherwise the load-system.

The Load System
The load-system's gears and functions are operated by the float-tank descent force.
1.  rail system:  rail dolly (the rail vehicle which carries each float-tank, one-at-a-time, into the water-tight-ascent compartment)
2.  the door of the water-tight-ascent compartment
3.  bail pump  -  removes the water on the bottom-floor of the engine system, via pumping the water into the water-tight-ascent compartment

The gear pushed (run; operated) by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean, pushes the next tank into the L and up into the water-tight compartment; the bottom of the tank is then closed by a door (operated, once again, by the gear pushed/run/operated by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean); then, a door on the side of the tank is opened, allowing water into the tank, underneath the hollow, affixed-to-tank, platform of the tank, thereby pushing the tank upward toward the top of the ocean.

How to insert the pipe to the bottom of the ocean.

Pipe (the main pipe), open at the bottom; open at the top; large enough (length, width) to hold (to house, to encompass vertically) a tank (an air-tight, engine-component, extremely large (ship-size) tank); insert into the ocean. Slot at the bottom (half a cirle slot opening in the side of the pipe); insert metal circle slab into slot; seal the slab into the pipe; pump out the water from the pipe.

Water-filled tank in pipe; when pipe fully inserted and slab sealed, then a hose to the bottom of the ocean, to the water-tank, pumps the water out of the tank, filling the tank with air; a very small, empty pipe to the bottom of the ocean, inside of the main pipe.

<h3>Section 2:  Sky-scraper Float-Tank Engine</h3>
<textarea id="id_t_2" class="class_t_1" >
Sky-Scraper Float-Tank Engines
Date of Invention:  12/28/2022 (December 28, 2022)

1.  Pipe (tube) of water to raise tanks; to turn gears (turbines)
2.  Empty Tube to lower tanks

    
Chain or Belt

Gear

Chain Arm (or belt arm)
Chain arm extensions
Chain-arms extend from the chains on at least two-sides of the water-path of the 
Belt-arms extend from the belt over the float-tank rise (ascension to surface of water) path area; float-tanks push arms upward by natural, free force in the water; the arms, as attached to the belt (or chain) push the belt upward, turning the gear at the top (or bottom) the belt (in the case of an float-tank-ocean-engine, the gear box turbine system will be at the top of the ocean; whereas, contrarily, the sky-scraper float-tank-engine may have the turbine gear system at the top (or bottom) of the building; sending electricity down (or up) thru the building.

The float tanks will be rectangular cubes.

Reasons
1.  A rectangular large float, with an arrow-dynamic top, is more easy (more simple) to manufacture than a circular-float-tank.
2.  A simple two-arm per each long-side (top) of the rectangular-float-tank can be protruded to stablely secure the upward force of each float-tank.

Smaller pipe to the bottom of the ocean; how, as follows:

float-tank sections as square-shaped slots, parts of the composition of the float-tank.

example:


float tank composed:  [____________]

or otherwise depicted as:  [|||||||||]

float tank parts:  [] + [] + [] + []

or otherwise depicted as:  [|  +  ||  +  ||  +  ||  +  ||  |]

Where each section connects to each other section to form (compose) the entire unit float-tank.

Where each section is detachable to permit it slide down (free fall by gravity, but connect to each by belt arms on either side of the free-fall pipe - which belt turns a turbine.

Where roof is arrow-dynamic, same as was designed before except as:, but is, also, per this design, composed of detachable sections, each of whose parts can fit in the free-fall pipe to descend to the bottom of the engine system, in the ocean (or otherwise).

Float-Tank-Components-Assembly
Float-tank composite parts are assembled (connected) to compose the float-tank-unit; where  -  at the bottom of the engine system, in the compartment beside the water-tight-air-tight-ascension-compartment

Sections of the Engine
Date:  12/29/2022 (December 29, 2022)

turbine-belt:  height:  design 2

10% parts per float-tank-height

If 100 float-tanks, then turbine-belt-height = (1/10 * (height of tank * 100 tanks)

Location
The turbine-belt is located at the top of the engine system, below the surface of the fluid volume part (such as the surface of the ocean) of the engine system.
The force of the connected-to-each-other, ascending float-tanks, pushes upward those float-tanks, at the top of the system, connected to the turbine-belt, moving the turbine-belt, which moves the turbine to create electric output (electron-flow-to circuit, energy result).


Ascension to Surface Procedure
Tank-to-Tank Connections
Tank-to-Pipe Connections
Guide Rail Above Water-Tight-Asencsion Compartment While aiming with rutter (wing components for float trajectory system of the each float-tank).
Sonar/Radar/Laser/Thermo-Scanning/Camera/Pipe-Arm Guidance system
Slot connection slot to connect
Pipe-guide-arm; guide arm lock; guide arm spring, guide-arm unlock upon spring half-way activation; then, free-motion-flow connection from pip-to-arm-to-float-tank during float-tank asencsion to surface

Introduction
I solved the earth's problem about a viable, clean, sustainable energy source. Now, I need to obtain, from the Federal Government (or otherwise from the Government of the United States, or funds and assistance from a US Company), the following: a team of design-artists (mechanical-systems-engineering-design-artists) to help me put together the prototype (the 3-D design and initial small-scale models of the engines).




Prototype Design Mechanical-Engineering Team
The design engineers will recieve division portions of the labor of designing the parts of each of the models. For example:

1.  One artist will draw the mechanical parts of the turbine
2.  Another artist will draw the mechanical parts of the descent turbine-belt
3.  Another artist will draw the mechanical parts of the descent pipe
4.  Another artist will draw the mechanical parts of the float-tank components and their connections
5.  Another artist will draw the load-system
6.  Another artist will draw the mechanical parts of the water-tight-ascent compartment

Team Composition
1.  head of team (department head; manager)
2.  team members (3-D-software-design-artists and engineers)
Description
The Head of the Department (manager) will organize the team, divying the tasks requiring time and effort to the members of the team, as the Head of the Department wants. The members will perform the tasks assigned to them. The members will show their products to the manager. The manager will assess, and will organize teams to assess (as necessary), the products; the manager will provide further instructions to modify each team-member's product(s), as needed.
