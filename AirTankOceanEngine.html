I just invented clean, free, efficient energy for the entire globe.

Air-tite, ship-large tanks, filled with patroleom aerated foam (or other floating material).

Pipe down into the ocean, empty pipe inserted, open at the top, "L-shaped" at the bottom; door at the "L-shape" at the bottom

The force of the tanks falling push a gear that opens the door.

A pump to the top of the ocean empties a tank compartement.

The gear pushed (run; operated) by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean, pushes the next tank into the L and up into the water-tight compartment; the bottom of the tank is then closed by a door (operated, once again, by the gear pushed/run/operated by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean); then, a door on the side of the tank is opened, allowing water into the tank, underneath the hollow, affixed-to-tank, platform of the tank, thereby pushing the tank upward toward the top of the ocean.

How to insert the pipe to the bottom of the ocean.

Pipe (the main pipe), open at the bottom; open at the top; large enough (length, width) to hold (to house, to encompass vertically) a tank (an air-tight, engine-component, extremely large (ship-size) tank); insert into the ocean. Slot at the bottom (half a cirle slot opening in the side of the pipe); insert metal circle slab into slot; seal the slab into the pipe; pump out the water from the pipe.

Water-filled tank in pipe; when pipe fully inserted and slab sealed, then a hose to the bottom of the ocean, to the water-tank, pumps the water out of the tank, filling the tank with air; a very small, empty pipe to the bottom of the ocean, inside of the main pipe.

<h3>Section 2:  Sky-scraper Float-Tank Engine</h3>

Sky-Scraper Float-Tank Engines

1.  Pipe (tube) of water to raise tanks; to turn gears (turbines)
2.  Empty Tube to lower tanks

    
Chain or Belt

Gear

Chain Arm (or belt arm)
Chain arm extensions
Chain-arms extend from the chains on at least two-sides of the water-path of the 
Belt-arms extend from the belt over the float-tank rise (ascension to surface of water) path area; float-tanks push arms upward by natural, free force in the water; the arms, as attached to the belt (or chain) push the belt upward, turning the gear at the top (or bottom) the belt (in the case of an float-tank-ocean-engine, the gear box turbine system will be at the top of the ocean; whereas, contrarily, the sky-scraper float-tank-engine may have the turbine gear system at the top (or bottom) of the building; sending electricity down (or up) thru the building.

The float tanks will be rectangular cubes.

Reasons
1.  A rectangular large float, with an arrow-dynamic top, is more easy (more simple) to manufacture than a circular-float-tank.
2.  A simple two-arm per each long-side (top) of the rectangular-float-tank can be protruded to stablely secure the upward force of each float-tank.
