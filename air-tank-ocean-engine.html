I just invented clean, free, efficient energy for the entire globe.

Air-tite, ship-large tanks, filled with patroleom aerated foam (or other floating material).

Pipe down into the ocean, empty pipe inserted, open at the top, "L-shaped" at the bottom; door at the "L-shape" at the bottom

The force of the tanks falling push a gear that opens the door.

A pump to the top of the ocean empties a tank compartement.

The gear pushed (run; operated) by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean, pushes the next tank into the L and up into the water-tight compartment; the bottom of the tank is then closed by a door (operated, once again, by the gear pushed/run/operated by the tanks floating to the top of the ocean); then, a door on the side of the tank is opened, allowing water into the tank, underneath the hollow, affixed-to-tank, platform of the tank, thereby pushing the tank upward toward the top of the ocean.

How to insert the pipe to the bottom of the ocean.

Pipe (the main pipe), open at the bottom; open at the top; large enough (length, width) to hold (to house, to encompass vertically) a tank (an air-tight, engine-component, extremely large (ship-size) tank); insert into the ocean. Slot at the bottom (half a cirle slot opening in the side of the pipe); insert metal circle slab into slot; seal the slab into the pipe; pump out the water from the pipe.

Water-filled tank in pipe; when pipe fully inserted and slab sealed, then a hose to the bottom of the ocean, to the water-tank, pumps the water out of the tank, filling the tank with air; a very small, empty pipe to the bottom of the ocean, inside of the main pipe
