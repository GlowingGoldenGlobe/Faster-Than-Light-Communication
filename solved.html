Faster than Light Communication:  Quantum Entanglement




Standards of Duration
Point A
  Standard of Duration of Observation-Measurement:  50 miliseconds
Point B
  Standard of Duration of Observation-Measurement:  200 miliseconds
Four Parts of 50s is 200.
i.e.,  ==>  50 MS * 4 = 200 MS.
It takes four events of observations each at a duration of 50 miliseconds to elapse the duration of the observation at Point B of 200 miliseconds.
Standard Set Duration
  At Point A  -  Four Observations each at durations of 50 miliseconds, equaling a total sum duration, at Point B, of a single, simultaneous observation of 200 miliseconds
  The "Standard Set Duration" is a standard for use as a standard among those standards of measurement, for the purpose of measuring messages of messages of quantum entanglement of faster than light communication.  For example, the "Standard Set Duration" may be a variable quantity per set-of-machine-devices-for-measurement-of-messages-of-faster-than-light-communication-using-quantum-entanglement.
Standard Set of Particles
  Each particle observed is observed via the usage of a standard-set-duration, as described, above.
  Each code-message-character is deciphered via measuring a change in a particle position-observed.
  Each code-message-character is deciphered via measuring a set-of-particles.  That is to say, for each single character to be sent from Point B to Point A, what is used to send said single (only-one-character) character message is a set-of-particles - a set of observations of a set of several particles, where each set of observations measures each particle of the set of particles one time (once; one measurement per particle of a set of particles per instance of a single set of observations).
  


Quantity of Particles Per Measurement Per Single-Digit Code Message of Particle(s) Position-Observed


Method 1
Where change in position = Code Message Sent
  If and only if change in particle position occurs at Point A as at least one observation of a set of four observations
Where a standard-set-duration of 4-observations-at-Point-A occurs for a standard-set-of-particles
  Where a variable is the variable-per-set-of-machine-devices-for-measuring-messages-from-said-set-of-devices-as-a-machine-for-measuring-said-messages
  Where an example-machine is an example-machine-measuring-system-of-a-set-of-devices (so-called, and example, because it is an example for purposes of this document, whereas, a machine-measuring-system-of-devices-for-measuring-messages-at-faster-than-light-speed may otherwise be use a different set of assigned quantities for variables versus the quantity-values assigned to the same variables in this document-example of such a machine-system.
  Where the variable-standard-set-of-particles is, for this example-machine is 100 particles in each set of particles.  In other words, standard-set-of-particles-variable = 100, for this example.
  If Point B changes its observation-duration from 200 miliseconds to 100 miliseconds, then, it is expected (and required) that at least one particle in a set-of-particles will change its position, (2) and will be measured as a change in position at Point A within a set of 4 observations during the simultaneous change-in-duration-of-observation at Point B.  It is, of course, expected, that the third observation (observation-3-of-4 of a set-of-4-observations) will notice the change in position of at least one particle in its set of observed particles as a reflection of the mirror of the change-in-duration-of-observation at Point B from 200 miliseconds to 100 miliseconds.
  
Method 2
Where change in position = Code Message Sent
  If and only if the change in the particle position-observed
If a
200 miliseconds observation duration changes to 400 miliseconds;  correspondingly the change of a set of particles will not change for the duration of two (2) sets-of-observations of particles at Point A, and, thus, the observation at Point A will record that the absence of a change for 2 sets-of-observations represents a code-character of the message.

Where the probability is 50%, the odds are overcome via the measurement of a set, and, indeed, multiple sets for the same single-code-message-character where the said "sets" are sets-of-particles representing that single-code-message-character. That is to say, each code-character of a message is to be represented and measured-using-an-entire-set-of-particles versus merely using one-particle-per-code-character-of-a-message;  and, in this way, the probability-problem of a measurement of a position of a particle per observation is overcome, additionally, via using a set of observations rather than merely a single observation to find a change (ambiguity, but understood).


Defintions and Explanations
"change in particle position"  is the equivalent of  "the change in the particle position-observed"

single-code-message-character
The term, single-code-message-character is used in this document to differentiate between using a single particle to measure a character versus using an entire set of particles to measure only one character of a message.  And, the measuring system, described in this document, above, always uses a set of particles to measure any one, single character of a message, and it never uses a single particle, alone (only), to measure a single character.
